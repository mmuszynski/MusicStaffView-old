             The major issue with this version of accessories is that they do not know where to draw in the vertical space.
             Unfortunately, the protocol-based design of elements causes accessories to not understand where they are in relation to their parent elements. And because the element protocol is designed to be adopted by already-existing musical elements (e.g. notes, accidentals, etc), there is no mechanism to store any extra information, such as parent elements.
             
             Previously, accidentals were all drawn as the notes were drawn, so this was less of an issue. Now, the layers are set up and the accessories are drawn in order. Perhaps accessories need a concrete element to store that extra information.
