 This file is filled with empty View protocol declarations along with a single method that allows all of these elements to conform to the protocol.
 
 Currently in Swift, there is no way to extend a protocol such that it will adopt a second protocol, which could then be extended with a default implementation. This is a workaround--the default implementation is provided, and the individual structs declare their conformance without providing any extra implementation.
